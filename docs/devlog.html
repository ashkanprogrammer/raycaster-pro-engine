    <h3>Raycasting Logic</h3>
    <p>
        The Raycaster Pro engine calculates the distance to walls by 
        sending rays from the player's position to the 2D map and uses 
        this distance to determine the height of the walls in 3D.

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge in this project was to fix the fish-eye effect,
         which caused the image to be stretched. This problem was solved by 
         correcting the angle calculations and normalizing the ray spacing.
